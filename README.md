mygameplayer
------------

This is a project that is at once both an experiment in new technology and an attempt to create something that I might actually find useful.

The application itself attempts to be a social gaming site geared towards tracking of meta information surrounding gaming groups. Essentially, if you get together with some friends to play games (board games, card games, poker, etc.) `mygameplayer` is set up to allow you to track your group's progress and organize sessions into long running campaigns. Achievements, rankings, and other metrics will be used to facilitate a more enjoyable meta game.

The technology being used is as follows:

**Back end**
* Django 1.8
* Tastypie (REST)
* PostgreSQL 9.3 

**Front end**
* ReactJS
* BackboneJS (models, collections and router)
* Twitter Bootstrap (sass edition)
* Grunt, Browserify, Compass (build processes and support libs)
